## Goals

Provide a set of C# static methods mimicking standard C library's behavior to be able to
straightforwardly make a first port of a C application to .NET core.

This initial port can then iteratively be converted into a more idiomatic .NET core
application, keeping it functional all the way through.

Ideally you would also have a strong set of unit tests that would support the refactoring
process.

As a starter, have some look at these [simple examples](./Examples.md)
